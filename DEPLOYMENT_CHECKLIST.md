# Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. API Authentication (401 Errors) - FIXED ✅
All API routes now properly use the `x-user-id` header from middleware:
- `/api/settings/profile` - Fixed GET and PUT methods
- `/api/settings/organization` - Fixed PUT method
- `/api/organization/invite` - Fixed POST method
- `/api/organization/members` - Fixed GET method

**Test:** All settings features and team management should now work.

### 2. Settings Tab Navigation - FIXED ✅
- Settings page now reads `?tab=members` URL parameter correctly
- "Manage Team" links will open the Members tab as expected

**Test:** Click "Manage Team" → should open Members tab, not Profile tab.

### 3. Task Detail Page - CREATED ✅
- Added `/tasks/[id]/page.tsx` route
- No more 404 errors when editing tasks
- Proper loading/error states implemented

**Test:** Click any task to edit → should open edit page, not 404.

### 4. Activities API - CREATED ✅
- Created `/api/activities` endpoint
- Returns empty array until migration is run

**Test:** Activity feed should show "No activity yet" instead of error.

## ⚠️ Manual Steps Required

### 1. Run Database Migration (REQUIRED)
The activities table migration needs to be run on your Supabase instance:

```bash
# Run this migration file:
database/migrations/013_create_activities_table.sql
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `database/migrations/013_create_activities_table.sql`
3. Paste and execute
4. Verify `activities` table is created

**OR** use your existing migration process.
