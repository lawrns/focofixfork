| 4 | oscar@fyves.com | 158c0385-f4b5-40f9-a647-a49f29fe3b8a | member | ⚠️ Not in auth.users |
| 5 | jose@fyves.com | 74d88017-f435-46c0-bbad-92e91849f730 | member | ⚠️ Not in auth.users |
| 6 | isaac@fyves.com | 59bbe21d-6a4d-49f8-a264-2ac4acd3060a | member | ⚠️ Not in auth.users |
| 7 | laurence@fyves.com | e15af19f-3e2b-4017-8b34-11a84e0898e6 | owner | ✅ Active |

### Actions Completed

1. ✅ **Identified all @fyves.com users** in the organization_members table
2. ✅ **Reset password for laurence@fyves.com** to `Hennie@@18`
3. ✅ **Verified Fyves organization** exists and is active
4. ✅ **Confirmed organization membership** for all 7 users

### Issues Identified

**Problem**: 6 users exist in `organization_members` table but not in `auth.users` table

This means these users were added to the organization but never had authentication accounts created. This is likely due to:
- Users being added to the organization before auth accounts were created
- Database migration or import that didn't include auth.users data
- Manual database manipulation

### Recommended Solutions

**Option 1: Create New Auth Users (Recommended)**
1. Create new auth users for each email address
2. Update `organization_members` table to use new user IDs
3. Notify users of their new credentials

**Option 2: Manual User Creation**
1. Have each user sign up through the application
2. Manually add them to the Fyves organization
3. Update their roles as needed

**Option 3: Database Migration**
1. Create auth users with specific UUIDs matching organization_members
2. Requires direct database access or custom SQL functions

### Login Credentials

**For laurence@fyves.com (Active)**:
- Email: `laurence@fyves.com`
- Password: `Hennie@@18`
- Status: ✅ Can log in
- Role: Owner

**For other users**:
- Status: ⚠️ Cannot log in (no auth accounts)
- Action Required: Create auth accounts

### Client-side Real-time Implementation

#### ✅ Real-time Hooks Implemented

- `useGlobalRealtime` - Global real-time events
- `useOrganizationRealtime` - Organization-specific events
- `useProjectRealtime` - Project-specific events
- `useMilestoneRealtime` - Milestone-specific events

**File**: `src/hooks/useRealtimeTeam.ts`
- `useRealtimeTeam` - Team real-time updates

**File**: `src/lib/stores/project-store.ts`
- `projectStore` - Global singleton store for cross-component synchronization
- Methods: `subscribe`, `addProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `getProjects`

#### ✅ Real-time Integration

**File**: `src/components/projects/ProjectTable.tsx`
```typescript
// Organization-specific real-time
useOrganizationRealtime(primaryOrgId || '', (payload: any) => {
  if (primaryOrgId) {
    handleRealtimeEvent(payload, 'organization')
  }
})

// Global real-time for personal projects
useGlobalRealtime((payload) => {
  const project = payload.new || payload.old
  if (project && (project.created_by === user?.id || !project.organization_id)) {
    handleRealtimeEvent(payload, 'global')
  }
})

// Subscribe to project store
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = projectStore.subscribe((projects) => {
    // Update local state when store changes
  })
  return unsubscribe
}, [])
```

### Real-time Configuration

**File**: `src/lib/supabase-client.ts`
```typescript
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    persistSession: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true
  },
  realtime: {
    params: {
      eventsPerSecond: 10  // ✅ Configured
    }
  }
})
```

## Testing Real-time Functionality

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Open two browser windows**
   - Window 1: Log in as laurence@fyves.com
   - Window 2: Log in as laurence@fyves.com (same user, different session)

2. **Test Project Creation**
   - Window 1: Create a new project
   - Window 2: Verify project appears immediately without refresh

3. **Test Project Update**
   - Window 1: Edit a project (change name, status, etc.)
   - Window 2: Verify changes appear immediately

4. **Test Project Deletion**
   - Window 1: Delete a project
   - Window 2: Verify project disappears immediately

5. **Test Task Updates**
   - Window 1: Create/update/delete a task
   - Window 2: Verify changes appear immediately

6. **Test Milestone Updates**
   - Window 1: Create/update/delete a milestone
   - Window 2: Verify changes appear immediately

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ Changes appear in real-time (< 1 second delay)
- ✅ No page refresh required
- ✅ All views update (table, kanban, gantt)
- ✅ Optimistic updates work correctly
- ✅ No duplicate entries
- ✅ Proper error handling
