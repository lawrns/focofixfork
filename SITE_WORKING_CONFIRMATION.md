## ⚠️ Expected Auth Failures (6/25)

These endpoints **correctly require authentication** - NOT errors:

```
⚠ /api/projects - 401 (requires auth cookie)
⚠ /api/milestones - 401 (requires auth cookie)
⚠ /api/tasks - 401 (requires auth cookie)
⚠ /api/goals - 401 (requires auth cookie)
⚠ /api/organizations - 401 (requires auth cookie)
⚠ /api/analytics/dashboard - 401 (requires auth cookie)
```

**These are working correctly** - they enforce security by requiring authenticated sessions.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Webpack Build Error** ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
**Solution:**
- Cleared Next.js cache (`.next` directory)
- Cleared node_modules cache
- Rebuilt application
- Restarted dev server

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - No more webpack errors

### 2. **Server Port Conflict** ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Port 3000 was in use
**Solution:** Started server on port 3001 explicitly
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Running on http://localhost:3001
