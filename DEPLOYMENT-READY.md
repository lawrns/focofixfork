## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Offline (5-7 days)
**Priority: HIGH** if you want full offline project management

- [ ] Implement IndexedDB storage layer
- [ ] Add offline support for CRUD operations
- [ ] Sync conflict resolution
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Background sync when coming online

**Benefits**:
- Store unlimited projects/tasks offline
- Full offline-first experience
- Work completely offline, sync later

### Phase 3: Push Notifications (5-7 days)
**Priority: MEDIUM** for user engagement

- [ ] Set up Supabase Edge Functions for push backend

**Benefits**:
- 40-60% increase in engagement
- Real-time collaboration alerts
- Higher retention rates

### Phase 4: App Store Distribution (1-2 weeks)
**Priority: LOW** (PWA works great without this)

- [ ] Use PWABuilder to generate Android APK (TWA)
- [ ] Submit to Google Play Store ($25 one-time)
- [ ] Optional: iOS wrapper for App Store ($99/year)

**Benefits**:
- More discoverability
- Higher user trust
