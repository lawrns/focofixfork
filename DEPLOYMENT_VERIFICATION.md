## üîç Registration Issues - Diagnostic Steps

If registration fails, check these:

### Browser Console Errors
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Attempt registration
4. Look for:
   - Red error messages
   - Network request failures
   - RLS policy errors
   - 401/403/406 status codes

### Network Tab Investigation
1. Open Developer Tools > Network tab
2. Attempt registration
3. Find the POST request to `/api/register` or `/api/auth/*`
4. Check:
   - Request payload (email, password sent?)
   - Response status (200, 400, 500?)
   - Response body (error messages?)

### Common Registration Issues

#### Issue: "User already exists"
**Solution:** Email might be taken, try different email

#### Issue: 401/403 Error
**Potential Causes:**
- Supabase keys incorrect
- RLS policies too restrictive
- Missing environment variables

**Check:**
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(window.ENV) // Check if env vars are set
```

#### Issue: "Email not confirmed"
**Solution:**
- Check Supabase email settings
- Or use auto-confirm in development

#### Issue: No redirect after registration
**Potential Causes:**
- Session not created
- Auth context not updating
- Redirect logic broken

#### Issue: RLS Policy Violation
**Check Database:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT tablename, policyname, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('users', 'user_profiles');
```

**Should see:**
- "Users can view all user profiles" (SELECT, public)
- "Users can update own profile" (UPDATE, public)
- Policies for INSERT on user_profiles
