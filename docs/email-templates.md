Hi [First Name],

We have exciting news: Foco is evolving to help you focus on what truly matters.

After analyzing how thousands of teams use Foco, we discovered something important: the most productive teams use the simplest features. So we're making Foco simpler by default.

### What's Changing

- **Advanced filters** → AI-powered Smart Inbox
- **Multiple Kanban layouts** → One beautiful board
- **File uploads** → Seamless Drive/Dropbox integration

### Why This Makes Foco Better

- **3x faster** task creation - no more forms to fill out

- **AI does the work** - automatic categorization and prioritization
- **Cleaner interface** - distraction-free productivity
